## Breakdown | Symptoms
To identify symptoms unique to each type of depression (psychotic depression, postnatal depression, and general depression in adults) and those common to all, we can categorize the symptoms based on their occurrence in each condition. Here's a breakdown:

Common Symptoms Across All Types of Depression:
Persistent feeling of sadness and low mood
Hopelessness and helplessness
Loss of interest in things once enjoyed
Fatigue and lack of energy
Disturbed sleep (trouble sleeping or oversleeping)
Changes in appetite (increase or decrease)
Difficulty concentrating and making decisions
Feelings of guilt or worthlessness
Suicidal thoughts or thoughts of self-harm
Unique Symptoms by Depression Type:
Psychotic Depression:
Hallucinations (hearing, seeing, or feeling things that are not there)
Delusions (strong beliefs in things that are not true)
Psychomotor agitation (restlessness, inability to sit still)
Psychomotor retardation (slowed thinking and physical movements)
Thoughts or beliefs reflecting deeply depressed mood (e.g., guilt about imagined crimes)
Postnatal Depression:
Trouble bonding with the baby
Frustration or anxiety about caring for the baby
Frightening thoughts about harming the baby
Withdrawing from contact with other people, including the baby
Lack of enjoyment in the wider world
Feelings of inadequacy as a parent
Symptoms developing within the first year after childbirth
General Depression in Adults (non-specific to other conditions):
Low self-esteem
Irritability and intolerance of others
Lack of motivation
Constipation
Unexplained aches and pains
Low sex drive (loss of libido)
Avoiding social contact
Neglecting hobbies and interests
Summary:
Common symptoms are those that overlap across all types of depression, indicating the core features of depressive disorders.
Psychotic depression is distinguished by psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions, along with specific physical manifestations like psychomotor agitation or retardation.
Postnatal depression includes symptoms related to the experience of parenting, such as difficulty bonding with the baby, frightening thoughts about harm, and feelings of inadequacy as a parent.
General depression in adults may include physical symptoms like constipation and unexplained pains, as well as social withdrawal and low libido, which are not necessarily connected to parenting or psychotic features.
This classification will help your expert system accurately identify and differentiate between these types of depression based on the symptoms presented by the user.
